Certainly! Here's a code example that generates the Fibonacci series in C#:


using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int count;
        
        Console.WriteLine("Enter the number of Fibonacci series terms to generate:");
        count = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        
        Console.WriteLine("Fibonacci Series:");
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        {
            Console.Write(Fibonacci(i) + " ");
        }
        
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
    
    static int Fibonacci(int n)
    {
        if (n <= 1)
        {
            return n;
        }
        else
        {
            return Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2);
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, the `Main()` method prompts the user to enter the number of Fibonacci series terms they want to generate. It then calls the `Fibonacci()` method to calculate and display the Fibonacci series.

The `Fibonacci()` method is a recursive function that calculates the Fibonacci number at a given index `n`. If `n` is 0 or 1, it simply returns `n`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` and sums up the results.

The program generates the Fibonacci series based on the user's input and displays it on the console.

Please note that this implementation uses recursion, which can be computationally expensive for large values of `n`. To optimize the code, you can use an iterative approach or memoization techniques.
